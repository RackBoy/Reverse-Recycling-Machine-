# Reverse-Recycling-Machine-
Final stage of the technological and environment project, made by Green Technology.   


Nowadays, climate change has become a critial situation that envolves almost everything and everyone. Having this in mind, the Green Technology team has conceived, designed and implemented a prototype version of a machine that pretends to save waste in exchange of points (an equivalen to to real money), therefore in that way, people can help the invironment while get some money in the process.
