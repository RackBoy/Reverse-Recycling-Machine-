# Reverse-Recycling-Machine-
Final stage of the technological and environment project, made by Green Technology.   


Nowadays, climate change has become a critial situation that envolves almost everything and everyone. Having this in mind, the Green Technology team has conceived, designed and implemented a prototype version of a machine that pretends to save waste in exchange of points (an equivalen to real money), therefore in that way, people can help the invironment while get some money in the process.

# Features
This project presents the interaction between three different kind of users, in order to reclycle waste (pre-registered user), register as a new user and clean the waste desposit. This was made using an embebided system, with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a Arduino Uno. 

In the first stage (user already registered), the potential user will be able to log in to their account using an specific password, then, the interface will led to the recycling process and add new points to their account. Once these points reach a certain amount, the user can exchange them for something of their prefrence such as: a snack or a coffee at the available stores.
