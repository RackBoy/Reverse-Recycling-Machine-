# Reverse-Recycling-Machine-
Final stage of the technological and environment project, made by Green Technology.   


Nowadays, climate change has become a critial situation that envolves almost everything and everyone. Having this in mind, the Green Technology team has conceived, designed and implemented a prototype version of a machine that pretends to save waste in exchange of points (an equivalen to real money), therefore in that way, people can help the invironment while get some money in the process.

# Features
This project presents the interaction between three different kind of users, in order to reclycle waste (pre-registered user), register as a new user and clean the waste desposit. This was made using an embebided system, with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a Arduino Uno. 

In the first stage (user already registered), the potential user will be able to log in to their account using an specific password, then, the interface will led to the recycling process and add new points to their account. Once these points reach a certain amount, the user can exchange them for something of their preference such as: a snack or a coffee at the available stores. 

If someone would like to use the device, however they don't have an account, the second section of the user cases can provide one. This process can be done following the instructions on the user interface, in other words, typing the new password and then confirm to be a new user.

The final case proposed is made for the people in charge of cleaning the device when it's full of waste. The user of this case will have an individual password and options wether to open or close the gates that save the waste. Besides, this person in charge can't use the options for recycling, just take off the waste. 

In order to provide aditional information about the users' stats, this project provides a web page where the users can find their information related to points and further. 

# Limitations 

Considering that the Reverse Recycling Machine is just a prototype version of the concept itself, there are certain aspects to develop further. One of those is the capacity of the new user the embebided system can allow and the way that it do it, since here it presents a demo with a few users. This considering the Hardware used and other aspects.

On the other hand, the dimensions of the device aren't real, that is, it's made only for prototype considerations, not for real users. That's why the machine can't allow huge quantities of waste, different types of it and further information already presented.
